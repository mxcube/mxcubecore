### Calling interface (for automation)
# This section is specific to the automated MXCuBE-web version, intended for MASSIF-1.
# It shows the interfaces between the Global Phasing workflow and a calling
# automation program running through MXCuBE,.

# Adding a GΦL workflow is done in the same way as adding an EDNA workflow.
# The parameters are a node ID and a task dictionary.
# The parameters relevant for GΦL  are, in yaml notation:

task:

parameters:
  # Process control and ???
  wfpath: Gphl  # Mandatory – specifies  GΦL workflow
  automation_mode: MASSIF1  # Optional,  defaults to None (manual)
  shape: some_shape_name  # Used for EDNA workflow, I do not know  what for

  # Strategy control
  strategy_name: "Native data collection"  # (str) Mandatory.
  # Options are: ‘Native data collection’, ‘Phasing (SAD)’
  # ‘Two-wavelength MAD’, ‘Three-wavelength MAD’, ‘Diffractometer calibration’

  # directory and file names. All optional, default to session default
  # See File Locations in manual
  prefix: <path_template.base_prefix>  # (str)
  suffix: <path_template.suffix>  # (str) Optional
  subdir: <Image path subdirectory>  # (str) Optional

  # Optional, overriding configured defaults:
  decay_limit: 25  # (%).
  # Minimum % intensity remaining at target resolution using recommended dose budget
  # dose_budget = 2 * resolution**2 * log(100. / decay_limit) / relative_sensitivity
  maximum_dose_budget: 20  # (MGy). Maximum when calculating budget from resolution
  characterisation_budget_fraction: 0.05  # dose fraction used for characterisation

  # Strategy name, matching strategylib.nml.
  auto_acq_parameters:  # (list of dict) automation parameters for acquisitions.
    # Optional.
    # The standard workflows have two acquisitions, characterisation and main;
    # diffractometer calibration has only one, and future workflows may have more.
    # The dictionaries are applied to the acquisitions in order;
    # if there is only one dictionary in the list, it applies to all acquisitions.
    # The following appear in task dictionaries in interactive MXCuBE3,
    # but are NOT used by the  GΦL workflow: wfname, wftype, strategies, type

    # The first dictionary are the parameters needed for MASSIF1 characterisation
    # where characterisation and first XDS run are done BEFORE starting the workflow
    # init_spot_dir can be set ONLY for characterisation
    # init_spot_dir, if set, turns off the workflow-driven characterisation
    # resolution, energies, and transmission are taken from the current values
    # in this case unless explicitly set
    - exposure_time: 0.04  # (s) Optional, default configured.
      # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
      image_width: 0.1    # (°) Optional, default configured.
      # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
      # use_dose: 20.0 # (MGy) Total dose. Optional. Overrides dose budget
      # transmission: 100.0 # (%) Nptional  Overrides use_dose.
      # Defaults to current valuee if init_spot_dir is set
      init_spot_dir: "/where/ever/dict"   # Directory containing SPOTS.XDS file
      # from preliminary XDS calculation
      # When init_spot_dir is set, strategy must be the name of the strategy
      # (specified in stragegylib.nml) that was actually used for characterisation.
      strategy: “Char_6_5_multitrigger”
      # Optional: Arithmetic crystal classes expected for the symmetry.
      # Will be used to select a matching indexing solution,
      # and to determine acquisition strategy.
      # If no matching indexing solution is found, these will be ignored.
      # Must be given in first (characterisation) set of auto_acq_parameters
      # crystal_classes:
      #   - 4I
      #   - 422I
      # Pass input cell and symmetry to XDS and processing and force their use as
      # starting point. Used to override XDS cell, symmetry determination
      use_cell_for_processing: false

    # acquisition parameters, for successive steps (characterisation or main).
    # This example lists all options, for documentation purposes
    # All are optional (except when init_spot_dir is set) and should normally
    # be left empty so the default is used.
    - resolution: 1.7  # (Å) Optional. Defaults to current value,
      # or to diffraction plan aimed_resolution
      energies: (12.4,)  # tuple(keV) List of energies to use in experiment.
      # two or three for MAD (only).
      # First wavelength will be used for calculating strategies, dose budget, etc.
      # Optional, except for MAD - will default to current beamline energy.
      exposure_time: 0.04  # (s) Optional, default configured.
      # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
      image_width: 0.1  # (°) Optional, default configured.
      # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
      wedge_width: 30.0  # (°) Wedge width (for interleaving)
      #  Optional, default configured.
      snapshot_count: 2  # Optional, default configured.
      use_dose: 20.0  # (MGy) NB Optional, for entire experiment.
      # Defaults to calculated dose budget. Resets transmission, exposure time
      transmission: 80.0  # (%) NB Optional  Overrides use_dose.
      # Defaults to current valuee if init_spot_dir is set
      # Otherwise is set from dose budget and resolution.
      # If set this value will reset the dose budget
      # Strategy variant
      # Default is “quick” for MAD, “full” for native or SAD
      strategy: full
      # Number of repetitions of entire strategy
      repetition_count: 1
      # Pass input cell and symmetry to XDS and processing and force their use as
      # startign point. Used to override XDS cell, symmetry determination
      use_cell_for_processing: false

      strategy_options:  # (dict) strategy calculation parameters. See below

        # strategy options. Control the stratcal strategy calculation program.
        # maximum_chi is automaticaly reduced to match kappa motor limits.
        maximum_chi: 48.0  # (°) Optional. Maximum chi value allowed for strategies.
        # Default 48
        angular tolerance: 1.0  # (°) Optional.
        # Tolerance to distinguish strategy orientations

# Other parameters are set (ultimately) from ISPyB. These are all optional:
# From crystal description:
#   unit cell  parameters
#   space_group,protein_acronym
# From diffraction plan:
#   radiation_sensitivity
#   aimed_resolution # Defaults to current resolution.
#   Serves a default for acquisition parameter resolution (see above)

# NB By default transmission is calculated by program to match the calculated dose
# budget, which ultimately depends on the beamline flux density, aimed resolution,
# energy, and beam size.(see parameters ‘decay_limit’ and ‘maximum_dose_budget’
# above. It is recommended not to set transmission or dose_budget explicitly
# (unless init_spot_dir is set) but to rely on the automatic transmission setting.
