### Calling interface (for automation)
# This section is specific to the automated MXCuBE-web version, intended for MASSIF-1.
# It shows the interfaces between the Global Phasing workflow and a calling
# automation program running through MXCuBE,.

# Adding a GΦL workflow is done in the same way as adding an EDNA workflow.
# The parameters are a node ID and a task dictionary.
# The parameters relevant for GΦL  are, in yaml notation:

task:

  parameters:
    # Process control and ???
    wfpath: Gphl  # Mandatory – specifies  GΦL workflow
    automation_mode: MASSIF1  # Optional,  defaults to None (manual)
    shape: some_shape_name  # Used for EDNA workflow, I do not know  what for

    # Strategy control
    strategy_name: "Native data collection"  # (str) Mandatory.
    # Options are: ‘Native data collection’, ‘Phasing (SAD)’
    # ‘Two-wavelength MAD’, ‘Three-wavelength MAD’, ‘Diffractometer calibration’

    # directory and file names. All optional, default to session default
    # See File Locations in manual
    prefix: <path_template.base_prefix>  # (str)
    suffix: <path_template.suffix>  # (str) Optional
    subdir: <Image path subdirectory>  # (str) Optional

    # Optional, overriding configured defaults:
    decay_limit: 25  # (%).
    # Minimum % intensity remaining at target resolution using recommended dose budget
    # dose_budget = 2 * resolution**2 * log(100. / decay_limit) / relative_sensitivity
    maximum_dose_budget: 20  # (MGy). Maximum when calculating budget from resolution
    characterisation_budget_fraction: 0.05  # dose fraction used for characterisation

    # Strategy name, matching strategylib.nml.
    auto_acq_parameters:  # (list of dict) automation parameters for acquisitions.
      # Optional.
      # The standard workflows have two acquisitions, characterisation and main;
      # diffractometer calibration has only one, and future workflows may have more.
      # The dictionaries are applied to the acquisitions in order;
      # if there is only one dictionary in the list, it applies to all acquisitions.
      # The following appear in task dictionaries in interactive MXCuBE3,
      # but are NOT used by the  GΦL workflow: wfname, wftype, strategies, type

      # The first dictionary are the parameters needed for MASSIF1 characterisation
      # where characterisation and first XDS run are done BEFORE starting the workflow
      # init_spot_dir can be set ONLY for characterisation
      # init_spot_dir, if set, turns off the workflow-driven characterisation
      # resolution, energies, and transmission are taken from the current values
      # in this case unless explicitly set
      - exposure_time: 0.04  # (s) Optional, default configured.
        # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
        image_width: 0.1    # (°) Optional, default configured.
        # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
        # use_dose: 20.0 # (MGy) Total dose. Optional. Overrides dose budget
        # transmission: 100.0 # (%) Nptional  Overrides use_dose.
        # Defaults to current valuee if init_spot_dir is set
        init_spot_dir: "/where/ever/dict"   # Directory containing SPOTS.XDS file
        # from preliminary XDS calculation
        # When init_spot_dir is set, strategy must be the name of the strategy
        # (specified in stragegylib.nml) that was actually used for characterisation.
        strategy: “Char_6_5_multitrigger”
        # Optional: Arithmetic crystal classes expected for the symmetry.
        # Will be used to select a matching indexing solution,
        # and to determine acquisition strategy.
        # If no matching indexing solution is found, these will be ignored.
        # Must be given in first (characterisation) set of auto_acq_parameters
        # crystal_classes:
        #   - 4I
        #   - 422I
        # Pass input cell and symmetry to XDS and processing and force their use as
        # starting point. Used to override XDS cell, symmetry determination
        use_cell_for_processing: false

      # acquisition parameters, for successive steps (characterisation or main).
      # This example lists all options, for documentation purposes
      # All are optional (except when init_spot_dir is set) and should normally
      # be left empty so the default is used.
      - resolution: 1.7  # (Å) Optional. Defaults to current value,
        # or to diffraction plan aimed_resolution
        energies: (12.4,)  # tuple(keV) List of energies to use in experiment.
        # two or three for MAD (only).
        # First wavelength will be used for calculating strategies, dose budget, etc.
        # Optional, except for MAD - will default to current beamline energy.
        exposure_time: 0.04  # (s) Optional, default configured.
        # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
        image_width: 0.1  # (°) Optional, default configured.
        # Mandatory if init_spot_dir is set
        wedge_width: 30.0  # (°) Wedge width (for interleaving)
        #  Optional, default configured.
        snapshot_count: 2  # Optional, default configured.
        use_dose: 20.0  # (MGy) NB Optional, for entire experiment.
        # Defaults to calculated dose budget. Resets transmission, exposure time
        transmission: 80.0  # (%) NB Optional  Overrides use_dose.
        # Defaults to current valuee if init_spot_dir is set
        # Otherwise is set from dose budget and resolution.
        # If set this value will reset the dose budget
        # Strategy variant
        # Default is “quick” for MAD, “full” for native or SAD
        strategy: full
        # Number of repetitions of entire strategy
        repetition_count: 1
        # Pass input cell and symmetry to XDS and processing and force their use as
        # startign point. Used to override XDS cell, symmetry determination
        use_cell_for_processing: false

        strategy_options:  # (dict) strategy calculation parameters. See below
          # strategy options. Control the stratcal strategy calculation program.
          # maximum_chi is automaticaly reduced to match kappa motor limits.
          maximum_chi: 48.0  # (°) Optional. Maximum chi value allowed for strategies.
          # Default 48
          angular tolerance: 1.0  # (°) Optional.
          # Tolerance to distinguish strategy orientations

# Other parameters are set (ultimately) from ISPyB. These are all optional:
# From crystal description:
#   unit cell  parameters
#   space_group,protein_acronym
# From diffraction plan:
#   radiation_sensitivity
#   aimed_resolution # Defaults to current resolution.
#   Serves a default for acquisition parameter resolution (see above)

# NB By default transmission is calculated by program to match the calculated dose
# budget, which ultimately depends on the beamline flux density, aimed resolution,
# energy, and beam size.(see parameters ‘decay_limit’ and ‘maximum_dose_budget’
# above. It is recommended not to set transmission or dose_budget explicitly
# (unless init_spot_dir is set) but to rely on the automatic transmission setting.
