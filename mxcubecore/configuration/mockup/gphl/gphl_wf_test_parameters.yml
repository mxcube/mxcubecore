### Calling interface (for automation)
# This section is specific to the automated MXCuBE-web version, intended for MASSIF-1.
# It shows the interfaces between the Global Phasing workflow and a calling
# automation program running through MXCuBE,.

# Adding a GΦL workflow is done in the same way as adding an EDNA workflow.
# The parameters are a node ID and a task dictionary.
# The parameters relevant for GΦL  are, in yaml notation:

task:

  parameters:
    # Web version only - otherwise ignored
    wfpath: Gphl  # Mandatory for web version– specifies  GΦL workflow
    shape: some_shape_name  # Used for EDNA workflow, I do not know  what for

    # automation_mode: MASSIF1    # Optional,  defaults to value in settings

    # Strategy control
    strategy_name: "Native data collection"  # (str) Mandatory.
    # Options are: ‘Native data collection’, ‘Phasing (SAD)’
    # ‘Two-wavelength MAD’, ‘Three-wavelength MAD’, ‘Diffractometer calibration’

    # directory and file names. All optional, default to session default
    # See File Locations in manual
    # prefix: <path_template.base_prefix>  # (str)
    # suffix: <path_template.suffix>  # (str) Optional
    # subdir: <Image path subdirectory>  # (str) Optional

    # Optional, overriding configured defaults:
    decay_limit: 25    #  (%).
    # Minimum % intensity remaining at target resolution with recommended dose budget
    # dose_budget = 2 * resolution**2 * log(100. / decay_limit) / relative_sensitivity
    maximum_dose_budget: 20    # (MGy). Maximum when calculating budget from resolution
    characterisation_budget_fraction: 0.05    # Dose to use for characterisation

    # Strategy name, matching strategylib.nml.
    auto_acq_parameters:  # list[dict] automation parameters for acquisitions. Optional
      # The standard workflows have two acquisitions, characterisation and main;
      # diffractometer calibration has only one, and future workflows may have more.
      # The dictionaries are applied to the acquisitions in order;
      # if there is only one dictionary in the list, it applies to all acquisitions.
      # The following appear in task dictionaries in interactive MXCuBE3, but are NOT
      # used by the  GΦL workflow: wfname, wftype, strategies, type

      # The first dictionary are the parameters needed for MASSIF1 characterisation
      # init_spot_dir sets a mode where characterisation and first XDS run are
      # done BEFORE starting the workflow, and SPOT.XDS is read from init_spot_dir
      # init_spot_dir can be set ONLY for characterisation
      # init_spot_dir, if set, turns off the workflow-driven characterisation, anf
      # resolution, energies, and transmission are taken from the current values
      # unless explicitly set

        #   Serves a default for acquisition parameter resolution (see above)

        # NB By default transmission is calculated by program to match the calculated
        # dose budget, which ultimately depends on the beamline flux density,
        # aimed resolution, energy, and beam size.(see parameters ‘decay_limit’
        # and ‘maximum_dose_budget’ above. It is recommended not to set transmission
        # or dose_budget explicitly (unless init_spot_dir is set) and rely on the
        # automatic transmission setting.
