# Eventually all objects should use the yaml config system like Beamline,
# but for now we can leave them as xml
#
# NBNB some objects that do not currently have their own config files
# would need those added (e.g. the centring methods)
#
_objects:
    # The !!o0map and the lines starting with '- ' give you an *ordered* dictionary
    # And thus a reproducible loading order
    !!omap
    # The values are the file paths to the configuration file for the
    # object, relative to the configuration file path(s)
    #
    # NB - the order is *NOT* arbitrary, as signal connnections are set
    # on one object that require the other to be already loaded.
