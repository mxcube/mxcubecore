# Configuration files

The MXCuBE core is organised as a tree of *HardwareObjects*, and configuration is organised with a file per HardwareObject. The (mandatory) topmost object in the tree is the *Beamline* object, which is configured in the `beamline_config.yml` file. This in turn contains the names of other configuration files, recursively, which may be a mixture of YAML and XML configuration files. The Beamline object can be accessed as an attribute of the HardwareRepository module (`HardwareRepository.beamline`). As of 2024-03-14 MXCuBE is in the middle of a change-over to a new system for configuration that uses YAML files instead of XML files, which has different ways of accessing the configuration data from inside the code.
HardwareObjects can be configured to contain both other hardware objects and properties. The former are identified relative to the container by a role.

## Finding the files
Configuration files are searched for by name in a series of directories given as a lookup path. This is specified either with the `--coreConfigPath` command line parameter to MXCuBE, or through the `MXCUBE_CORE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. The files live under the `mxcubecore/mxcubecore/configuration` directory, typically with a directory for each beamline (which may or may not be up to date relative to the actual beamline environment).

## Yaml-configured objects
### Code and file structure
Each YAML-configured object has a `name` attribute, which is equal to the role that identifies the object within the containing object (the name of the Beamline object is `beamline`).

YAML-configured objects must be subclasses of the `BaseHardwareObjects.ConfiguredObject` class. The most complete example is the Beamline object and the comments in `beamline_config.yml` are the best guide to the syntax of YAML configuration files. It is a key principle of YAML-configured classes that **all** attributes added in the configuration must match a pre-defined attribute coded in the class. This means that you can look in the class code to see which attributes are available. The only exception is the `_initialise_class` attribute at the start of the file. This dictionary contains the import name of the class that is to be created, and optionally parameters to be passed to the `init()` method of that class. The `_objects` attribute gives the HardwareObjects that are contained in (i.e. children of) the object. The dictionary key is the role name, and the value is the name of the configuration file. Each `role_name` must match a read-only property coded in the body of the class, and must be added to the `__content_roles` list of the class by the class code. Note that classes are loaded and initialised in the order given by this list, so that there is a reproducible loading order. Contained objects can be defined as procedures, so that they are added to the list of procedures. Each YAML-configured class has an `_init()` method that is executed immediately after the object is created, and and `init()` function that is executed after configured parameters and contained objects have been loaded.

### Accessing configuration data
The Beamline object (`HardwareRepository.beamline`) is a YAML-configured object, and is the starting point for finding other hardware objects. These may in turn contain other objects, so you can do e.g. `HardwareRepository.beamline.detector.distance` to get the detector distance motor object. Configured properties are similarly accessed as simple attributes, e,g, `beamline.default_acquisition_parameters`. Each object has three special properties and one function to deal with the objects contained within it. These are:

- `all_roles`: a list of the roles (attribute names) of contained HardwareObjects, in loading order;
- `all_objects_by_role`: an ordered dictionary of HardwareObjects;
- `procedures` an ordered dictionary of HardwareObjects for procedures;
- `replace_object()`: a function to replace an existing configured object at runtime with a new object.

## XML-configured objects
### Code and file structure
XML-configured objects have a `name()` method, that returns the name of the configuration file used to specify it (without the `.xml` suffix). It is this name that is used in internal data structures and a number of access functions.

XML-configured objects must be subclasses of the `BaseHardwareObjects.HardwareObject` class. A good example is `mxcubecore/configuration/mockup/detector-mockup.xml` (note that `hwrid` is an alias for what is normally written as `href`). In XML configuration contained objects are given using the "object" element, with the `href` attribute giving the configuration file name to pick up (you can use a similar syntax to redirect the topmost element to another file) and the `role` attribute giving the role name. Properties (both simple, and nested structures) are given as contained XML elements. The configuration data are kept in complex internal data structures, with links back to the original XML.

The important functions can be found in the `BaseHardwareObjects,HardwareObjectNode` class. XML-configured files have no limits on the attributes or objects they can contain. This leads to greater flexibility, since you can add a new attribute when needed without modifying the class code; it also means that there is no way to check which attributes are supported without looking into the configuration files, and gives more scope for local and potentially conflicting implementations. The functions have quite complex behaviour that amounts to overloading.

### Accessing configuration data

The recommended way to access contained objects is through the `get_object_by_role` function, since it works on role names rather than the less predictable file names. As implemented the function will look recursively in contained objects for a given role name if the topmost object does not contain it. The `get_roles` method returns a list of roles that are defined on the object itself.

You can get and set the values of properties by normal `obj.attr` syntax, which will also get you non-property attributes. The `get_properties` method returns a dictionary of all properties and their values, and the `get_property` method behaves as `get_properties().get`. Direct setting of properties internally calls the `set_property` function, and this function automatically converts strings to `int`, `float` or `bool` if possible.

There are additional ways of accessing contained objects. `get_objects` and `has_object` take as input the object name, i.e. the name of the configuration file that specifies the object (or objects) (which is by definition globally unique). An XML-configured object is also coded to mimic a Python list and dictionary of contained objects, so that `anObject[ii]` (`ii` being an integer) returns the `ii`'th contained object, whereas `anObject[key]` (key being a string) returns the contained object defined by the name (i.e. config file name).
