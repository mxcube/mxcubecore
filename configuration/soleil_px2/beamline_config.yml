# FIRST DRAFT of SOLEIL px2 configuration. TO BE EDITED

# The class to initialise, and init parameters
_initialise_class:
    class: mxcubecore.hardware_objects.Beamline.Beamline
    # Further key-value pairs here will be passed to the class init
#    mode: devel

# objects
#
# Eventually all objects should use the yaml config system like Beamline,
# but for now we can leave them as xml
#
# NBNB some objects that do not currently have their own config files
# would need those added (e.g. the centring methods)
#
_objects:
    # The !!o0map and the lines starting with '- ' give you an *orderd* dictionary
    # And thus a reproducible loading order
  !!omap
    # The values are the file paths to the configuration file for the
    # object, relative to the configuration file path(s)
    #
    # NB - the order is *NOT* arbitrary, as signal connnections are set
    # on one object that require the other to be already loaded.
