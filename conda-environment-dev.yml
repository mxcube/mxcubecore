  # We install `python-ldap` from conda because it is "hard" to install.
  # On PyPI it is not available as *wheel*, only as *sdist* which requires to be built
  # with compilation steps that require a compiler and some header files.
  # Installing with conda is much "easier".
  #
  # IMPORTANT:
  # Always make sure that `python-ldap` here is pinned to the same version
  # as in the Poetry lockfile `poetry.lock` (not the other way around).
