# Backend of MXCuBE
mxcubecore is the back-end level of [MXCuBE Qt](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube/) and [MXCuBE Web](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube3/)  allowing to access the beamline control system and instrumentation. It acts as a container of single python objects (called hardware objects).

# Installation

Installation of the mxubecore module is commonly done as a depdency of either [MXCuBE Web](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube3/) or [MXCuBE Qt](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube/).

Standalone installation of the moudle can be done via poetry `poetry install` or for development purpouses (creating a symlink to the current folder) by using pip: `pip install -e .`. Don't forget the trailing "." (period).

mxcubecore depends on python-ldap that in turn depends on the openldap system library. It can be installed through conda by installing the openldap depdency: `conda install openldap` or on systems using apt-get: `sudo apt-get install -y libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev slapd ldap-utils tox lcov valgrind`. See [python-ldap](https://www.python-ldap.org/en/python-ldap-3.4.3/installing.html#debian) for more information.
